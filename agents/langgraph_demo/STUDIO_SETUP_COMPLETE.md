## 🔍 Your Multi-Agent Workflow

```
START → Researcher Agent → Chart Generator Agent → END
```

**Researcher Agent** 🔍
- Searches the web for information
- Uses Tavily search tool
- Never creates charts (passes data to Chart Generator)

**Chart Generator Agent** 📊
- Creates visualizations from data
- Uses Python code execution tool
- Marks tasks as complete with "FINAL ANSWER"

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

### **1. Verify Everything Works**
```bash
cd agents/langgraph_demo
source ../.venv/bin/activate
python test_studio.py
```

### **2. Start the Studio**
```bash
./start_studio.sh
```

### **3. Try Example Prompts**
- "Get UK GDP data and create a chart"
- "Research AI trends and visualize them"
- "Find stock data for Apple and create a graph"

## 🎉 Benefits You Now Have

✅ **Real-time Visualization**: See your agents work live  
✅ **Step-by-step Debugging**: Monitor each execution step  
✅ **Tool Monitoring**: Track which tools are used and when  
✅ **Error Detection**: Quickly identify and fix issues  
✅ **Performance Metrics**: Monitor execution times and costs  
✅ **Workflow Optimization**: Test different configurations  
✅ **Interactive Testing**: Try different prompts and see results  

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start the studio** and explore the interface
2. **Test different prompts** to see how your agents respond
3. **Monitor tool usage** to optimize performance
4. **Add new agents** or modify existing ones
5. **Experiment with different workflows** and routing logic

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Studio Won't Start**
- Ensure you're in the `agents/langgraph_demo` directory
- Check that the virtual environment exists at `../.venv/`
- Verify all dependencies are installed

### **Browser Doesn't Open**
- Check the terminal for the local URL (usually `http://localhost:7860`)
- Manually open the URL in your browser

### **Import Errors**
- Activate the virtual environment: `source ../.venv/bin/activate`
- Check that all required packages are installed
